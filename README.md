# RailRoadGraph

This is a demo to showcase my skills to employers. It is a graph that represents a railway system comprised of cities connected by one-way rail road tracks. WARNING: To keep this demo simple, it assumes that cities can be uniqely identified solely by name and thus there are no cities that share the same name. It has an API for adding cities as well as 
routes between those cities. It can also crunch path related data such as the shortest path between two cities.
